  BACKGROUND
 
 
   Founded in 1933 at the behest of Albert Einstein, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has developed unparalleled expertise in responding to emergencies and helping communities rebuild. The IRC is committed to a culture of bold leadership, innovation, creative partnerships, and, most crucially, accountability to those we serve. At work today in over 40 countries and 28 U.S. cities, IRC restores safety, dignity, and hope to millions who are uprooted. The IRC’s vision is to lead the humanitarian sector through implementing high-impact, cost-effective programs for people affected by crisis and by using our learning and experience to shape policy and practice. To achieve that vision, the IRC’s Technical Excellence (TE) provides technical assistance to IRC’s country program staff and share learnings to influence policy and practice. TE is comprised of five technical units: Economic Recovery and Development; Education; Governance; Health; and Violence Prevention and Response.
 
 
 
   In 2022, the IRC reached over 800,000 children and youth in 20 countries with education programs. We ensure that even the hardest to reach children in the most challenging places are able to go to school and thrive. In the midst of conflict and disaster, education is one of the first things parents and children say they need. Education is a human right. It also helps keep children safe and gives them the skills needed to be resilient, do well now, and later in life. Education offers a glimmer of hope. The IRC defines success with education outcomes from infancy to young adulthood, ensuring results for all girls and boys, regardless of age. These outcomes are: early childhood learning and nurturing care; primary school-aged learning; and youth learning; as well as the complementary safety in school outcome.

     About ELCA
      We are ELCA, one of the largest Swiss IT tribe with over 2,000 experts. We are multicultural with offices in Switzerland, Spain, France, Vietnam and Mauritius. Since 1968, our team of engineers, business analysts, software architects, designers and consultants provide tailor-made and standardized solutions to support the digital transformation of major public administrations and private companies in Switzerland. Our activity spans across multiples fields of leading-edge technologies such as AI, Machine & Deep learning, BI/BD, RPA, Blockchain, IoT and CyberSecurity.
     
   
   
    
     
      Your role
      
    
     
      ELCA is supporting the Swiss Post in developing the systems and algorithms that will implement the future planning and optimization of mail and parcel delivery, within the “Tourenplanung Next Generation” (TPNG) initiative. Building such a system is a particularly challenging undertaking given the Swiss Post’s current heterogeneous and fragmented planning landscape used to orchestrate a myriad of services and resources (e.g. more than 14’000 mail carriers and vehicles).
       In this internship, you will be a data scientist in an interdisciplinary team consisting of diverse profiles (data scientists, operational research experts, business analysts, developers, solution architects and business experts). Your main task will be to support the data scientists in one of the TPNG studies that will take place during Spring 2024.
       The high-interest topics that can be object of study during the internship include:
      
        Understand tour-stop patterns and associated delivery points, to predict the optimal vehicle stopping location given a set of mailboxes to be serviced, considering delivery workload and estimated parcel handover times.
        Investigate the GPS traces of delivery vehicles to determine deviations from the proposed tour plan and their impact on efficiency. Study the integration of implicit feedback from driver behavior (deviations) into the tour planning algorithms, enabling automated improvement of tour structure.
        Improve existing methodologies and systems to dynamically redirect parcels to the optimal distribution channels.
        Contribute to the development and refinement of tour sequencing and routing systems that will ultimately produce the planned delivery tours.
      
       The scope and objectives and the project will be further defined according to type of the internship (Master Thesis / Industry internship), to the current needs of the Swiss Post, but also to the research interest and desires of the student.
      
       Tackle a challenging data science problem in the last mile delivery domain:
      
        Understand the available data and the business needs
        Conduct a literature review to identify suitable solution approaches. Implement, test and analyse them
      
       Communicate your findings to business stakeholders and take in their feedbacks

        Personal development through training and coaching
        A culture of collaboration across all disciplines
        The chance to make a difference in peoples’ life by building innovative solutions

    ns1:hasDescription """The primary mission of AISTS is to master sport by positively contributing to sports management through a multidisciplinary approach to education and sciences and by remaining at the forefront of the sports industry’s development and the Olympic movement’s evolution. 
  The AISTS focuses its activities around three pillars:
   
   Education Applied Research Connections
   
   The AISTS office is located in Lausanne – the Olympic Capital – on the shores of Lake Geneva, surrounded by a breath-taking view of the Alps. Home to the International Olympic Committee, the surrounding region hosts over 60 international sport organisations, together with a concentration of internationally renowned universities and research centres. The AISTS is a non-profit organisation, founded in 2000 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the EPFL, University of Geneva (UNIGE), University of Lausanne (UNIL), IMD Business School, Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL), City of Lausanne and Canton of Vaud. 
  AISTS MAS - MASTER IN SPORT MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY As an academy, the mission of the AISTS is to generate rigorous and relevant knowledge and provide high quality education in order to prepare sport administrators to satisfy the needs and expectations of the sports industry. To achieve this, the AISTS has offered the AISTS MAS (Master of Advanced Studies in Sports Management and Technology) since 2003; a unique international postgraduate degree taught over 15 months in Lausanne. The AISTS MAS degree is co-signed by AISTS, EPFL, University of Geneva and University of Lausanne. Sport managers today need a broad knowledge base to understand the various issues facing sport organisations and federations. With this in mind, the academy’s primary goal is to provide a multidisciplinary approach to sports management education. To accomplish this goal, the AISTS applies the following scientific Modules to sport: 
  
   Management 
   Technology 
   Law 
   Medicine 
   Sociology 
   Careers 
   
  The teaching approach combines relevant case studies, field observations, interactive seminars, online teaching, and on-site visits organised as part of the Transdisciplinary topics. An international staff of more than 100 lecturers and speakers teaches the participants. Professionals from the sports industry teach 50% of the classes, while lecturers from academic institutions lead the other 50%. AISTS academic lecturers are professors from the leading universities in Europe and beyond, while speakers from the field are directors and project leaders from: 
  
   World sports organisations such as the International Olympic Committee, Fédération Internationale des Sports Universitaires (FISU), International Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAIFS), International Paralympic Committee (IPC), etc. 
   International sport federations from sports such as volleyball, skiing, football, basketball, archery, rowing, athletics, tennis, squash, modern pentathlon, gymnastics, swimming, hockey, cycling, air sports, etc. 
   Sports companies (agencies, media, consulting etc) such as Infront, CAA Eleven, European Broadcast Union (EBU), European Club Affairs, LaLiga, Event Knowledge Services, Sports Recruitment International, Shankai Sports, etc. 
   Sports event organisers such as Youth Olympic Games Lausanne 2020, Rio 2016, Freeride World Tour, Geneva Open, etc. 
   Governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations such as the World Anti-Doping Agency, Court of Arbitration for sport, UNICEF, ILO, WHO, etc 
   
  The program aims to provide participants with a 360° view of sports administration, together with tools to further develop their career and leadership.
